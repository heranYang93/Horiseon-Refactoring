    HTML - Refactored Principles (HRP):

    HRP1 - Container tags are reassigned to reflect their relevance to the structure (e.g. <div> are reassigned to <sections> where the area is more content-oriented)
    HRP2 - Contents sharing same hierarchy are placed under a list
    HRP3 - Adding 'alt' attributes to embed descriptive messages for assessibility reasons

    Created descriptive messages when sections are folded, attempting to increase readability

                    The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

                    The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
